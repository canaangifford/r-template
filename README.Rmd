Install the latest version of renv globally from CRAN with:
Note: This should be done globally via `R` on the cmdline.
See: https://github.com/rstudio/renv

install.packages("renv")
```

Pandoc is required to generate the README as well as use .Rmd files. If you are using RStudio you can 'Knit' or run via the cmdline. 
If you are not using RStudio you will have to install pandoc [globally](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
``` r 
rmarkdown::render('README.Rmd')
```

``` r
renv::install()
