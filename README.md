# r-template

Templated R Project with useful structure

## Initial Installation

Just start `R` in the project and `renv` will begin setup!

Pandoc may be required to generate the README as well as use .Rmd files.
If you are using RStudio you can ‘Knit’ or run via the cmdline. If you
are not using RStudio you will have to install pandoc
[globally](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

    rmarkdown::render('README.Rmd', 'md_document')

OPTIONAL - Install the latest version of renv globally from CRAN with:

    install.packages("renv")

See: <https://github.com/rstudio/renv>
